PICKUP_AND_DELIVERY_SECTION :
Each line is of the form

      <integer> <integer> <real> <real> <real> <integer> <integer>

The first integer gives the number of the node.
The second integer gives its demand (ignored).
The third and fourth number give the earliest and latest time for the node.
The fifth number specifies the service time for the node.
The last two integers are used to specify pickup and delivery. The first of
these integers gives the size of the pickup, whereas the second integer gives
the size of the delivery.
